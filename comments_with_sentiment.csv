I think Alonso is an amazing driver and I hope they keep him around for as long as possible. I think Stroll should have been dropped a long time ago. Had a better driver been in the car at the beginning of the season, Aston would have more constructor points and possibly finished higher this season than what they will now. 

Regardless of the drivers, regardless of if Stroll were to eventually sell the team, I hope it remains an Aston Martin car. I love seeing that British racing green on the track. 

I’ll never have enough to own a luxury sports car, but if I could own any car I wanted, it would be an Aston. For 110 years, this company has made gorgeous cars.

"> What I mean is irrespective of who drives for the team, you'll always support Aston Martin.

I think for Ferrari, Williams, McLaren that's easy to have those fans as those teams have been around forever. So you support them cause they are a permament fixture on the calendar.

Aston Martin has been Jordan Grand Prix, MF1 Racing, Spyker F1, Force India, Racing Point, Aston Martin - it's hard to establish a loyalty to a team whose identity and leadership changes with the wind. 

Whereas with Ferrari you have this long history of associating with the team, the team culture that puts Team > driver, and you can be a fan off track with the road cars.

Aston Martin Lagonda have made some absolutely brilliant road cars once they focused on sporty grand tourers (they had previously tried to compete with Bentley and Rolls Royce prior), with the seminal DB2 series from the early 1900s being the genesis.

The DB4 was when people started to take them seriously, more so when Zagato got their hands on it and turned out a proper race car with the DB4 GTZ.

James Bond came along and skyrocketed the marques' profile with the DB5, and subsequent DB6, DBS and original V8.

Racing Point/Force India/AML F1 are the same, let's not make a huge deal about the Stroll family cash injection. It's NOTHING compared to the massive cash and expertise levels of Ferrari, Mercedes or Red Bull.

In theory, on paper, Mercedes F1 is more valuable than an unknown “Brawn GP” which casual viewers never heard of. And Aston Martin F1 is more valuable than a random name like Force India or Racing Point. It’s about building an heritage à la Ferrari, Williams or McLaren, more or less

AM the auto maker is almost not giving any direct money to the team, which seems normal taking into account the auto maker have different investors than the F1 team (so Toto or Stroll partners would be paying for the team and Lance adventures just because? I doubt it) and the auto maker also had a recent crisis with the need to renew models and escape the route of constantly losing money.

Strol Sr just happen to want to invest on the auto maker, fix it and maybe resell it, and meanwhile, he happened to think it would be cool to use the name on the F1 team.

"I don't know the background behind all of that, but it does make sense.

The added exposure and brand association would increase the value of the shares in both the F1 team and the auto manufacturer. I'd assume Aston-Martin gets a cut of the merch profits as well as access to the drivers for specific trade events, so there's still value even if AM aren't paying the F1 team.

The F1 team would lose out on the money of another sponsor, but if Stroll Sr is making that up with share value, he may not care at all. Looking at the chart, AM shares bottomed out during Covid, but jumped almost 50% once the livery was shown (though it could just be coincidence). It peaked at about £790 per share in Feb 2021, which is when the F1 livery was revealed, and hovered around the mid-700s until the end of the F1 season when it dropped, and kept dropping to a low of £95 per share in September last year.

Looks like it actually rose early in the 2023 season while Fernando was looking good, and has dropped off since.

So there's an argument to be made for some correlation between doing well on the track and share value increase, but the inverse could also be true, at least in this case.

Though with Covid messing up the whole market from 2019 to now, it'd be hard to draw strong conclusions.
